## Introduction

The K-means algorithm is a widely used unsupervised clustering method in data analysis. It aims to partition a dataset into a certain number of clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

## Description
   
1. **Data Mining:** Before applying K-means, it is essential to explore and understand the data to determine the optimal number of clusters.

2. **K-means implementation:** Use the K-means algorithm to cluster data. Make sure you choose the right number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method.

3. **Evaluation of results:** Evaluate the performance of the K-means classification using metrics such as intra-cluster inertia or silhouette.
